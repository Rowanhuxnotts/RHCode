# RHCode
A repo of the code currently (and previously) worked on for my PhD. This includes development, experiment, and analysis files. 

## Comments / data storage, etc.

- in [RH data folder](./TWPsychophysics/Data/RHData) I put an example of reorganised data file (CSV in this case)
- [pandas cheatsheet](https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf) has some details on how to reshape data / reorganise
- nice aspect: `R` and `python/DataFrames` have similar methods for operating, so you'll be able to look at data quickly if things are organised consistently.
- will try to move some of the discussion on code to pull requests / discussions on github, so we can refer to code snippets, lines.

=======

Currently working on-

-Making the data I'm working from tidy

-Improving the readme files (including this one) from a template I found (https://gist.github.com/DomPizzie/7a5ff55ffa9081f2de27c315f5018afc)
