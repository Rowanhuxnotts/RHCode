# RHCode
A repo of the code currently (and previously) worked on for my PhD. This includes development, experiment, and analysis files. 

Currently working on-
-Making the data I'm working from tidy (So far have done just need the files to use the tidy data
-Polynomial regressions for the overtime analysis
-Improving the readme files (including this one) from a template I found
