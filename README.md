# RHCode

RH - created this 11/2024

A repo of the code currently (and previously) worked on for my PhD. This includes development, experiment, and analysis files. 

## Analysis code

- requires some packages, which are summarised in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file
- to recreate a conda environment with those packages from scratch, you can use
```bash
conda create -n rh-analysis --file requirements.txt
conda activate rh-analysis
```

## RH's notes

- Improving the readme files (including this one) from a template I found (https://gist.github.com/DomPizzie/7a5ff55ffa9081f2de27c315f5018afc)
