# RHCode
A repo of the code currently (and previously) worked on for my PhD. This includes development, experiment, and analysis files. 

Currently working on-

-Making the data I'm working from tidy (So far have done just need the files to use the tidy data

-Polynomial regressions for the overtime analysis

-Improving the readme files (including this one) from a template I found (https://gist.github.com/DomPizzie/7a5ff55ffa9081f2de27c315f5018afc)
